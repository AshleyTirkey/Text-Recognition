# Text-Recognition

Library used in this project is "easyocr" which is used for optical character recognition. It is based on deep learning models which involves text recognition and detection models and "PIL" (Python Imaging Library)  also known as Pillow Library, this library provides extensive file support, and efficient internal representation, and fairly image processing capabilites.

Optical Character Recognition helps the computer to recognise the text from images and thats the basic flow of this project.

Through this code we are able to input an image file and then we are able to recognise the characters in the image with the capabilities of easyocr and using PIL to process the image further and returning the output in an txt file which can be saved in the desired location in your system for which you'll have to edit out the directory accordingly.
